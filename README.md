### Hi there 👋

My specialization is Cloud Computing ☁️. I am also working as a research assistant at the Karmy Pain Clnic where I am creating a pain detection solution. I am passionate about building scalable and efficient Cloud solutions as well as furthing my own learning and personal growth. I have a great interest in exploring the latest in Cloud technologies and have found this constantly evolving field of study very reqrding to learn more about. Currently I am focusing my studies on learning AWS, Cloud Infrastructure, and Virtualization.
